The dataset- 'Bank Customer Churn Prediction' contains records of over 10,000+ customers such as their current balance, marital status, age, gender, tenure, churn(the output variable in our case, which is a categorical variable containing 0 and 1 type of values: 0 denoting the customer hasn't been churned, and 1 denoting that the customer has churned out the bank)
Aim of the project: For a bank its customers are the most valuable assest, as they are the ones from which the bank generates its revenue. Thus a customer churning out of the bank is a major issue for it, and it needs to get an estimate of how many customers or what percentage of them are leaving and for what reason.
My aim for this project was the same : To determine the percentage of customers being churned out of the bank and what are the possible reasons for it, so that the bank can take meaningful decision to reduce this number.
